'WHAT THE FLICK' uses the Angular framework and the Movie Database API to bring forth a functional movie app. 


In this app, the user can search films by genre, create a favorites list, and a watch list. Much like the apps commonly used today,
users of this app are sure to come across some of their favorite flicks of all time. 



App Created by Carmen Griffin, Megan Carnaghi, Brandi Tarver, and Ami Ross
